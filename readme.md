The source code of machine learning model's of TanahKu: Soil Classification and Crop Recommendation App
# Dataset
This dataset consist of two dataset which are Soil Dataset and Crop dataset. Soil dataset itself consists of Soil Image and Soil description which contains photos and descriptions of each soil.
Crop dataset itself consists of Crop image and crop description which contains photos and description of each crop
# Model
The model used in the application file is called Soil_Model.ipynb.

The model is then downloaded to become an h5 file called model.h5.

then from the h5 model, converted to tflite using the source code in deploy.ipynb
